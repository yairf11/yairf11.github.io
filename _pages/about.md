I am a second year PhD student at [Cornell Tech](https://tech.cornell.edu/), advised by [Prof. Yoav Artzi](https://yoavartzi.com/).
My current research focuses on the efficient use of knowledge by LLMs.

Before Starting my PhD, I spent several years as an applied computer vision researcher and data scientist.

I hold a MSc in Computer Science from the [Technion](https://www.cs.technion.ac.il/),
where I was advised by [Ran El-Yaniv](https://csaws.cs.technion.ac.il/~rani/).
Prior to that, I completed my BSc in software engineering, also at the Technion.
